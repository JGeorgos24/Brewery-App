## Project Description

The goal of our app is to create a brewery finder and beer rater for beer lovers. A user can add a rating of a brewery they find on the brewery list if they have visited the brewery. Users can also add a brewery to there personal profile. Within a users profile a user can add their favorite brewery to a favorite brewery list, add any brewery a user has visited to their visited brewery list and a user could also add future brewery's they want to visit to a want to visit brewery list.

### MVP/PostMVP 
The functionality of our website will be broken down into separate list: MVP and Post MVP. MVP will be the minimum viable product our client expects to see out of our website. Post MVP will be any additional product we can add to our website to improve functionality and styling.

#### MVP for Brewery App
- A front-end React application that updates the UI and makes requests to the API.
- Include data from a third-party API. In our case we would use a brewery API. 
- Create a GitHub Repo with all project members as collaborators.
- Establish a gitwork flow so all collaborators can save and upload properly.  
- Have a header with website title and signup/login features.
- Construct a nav bar to navigate to brewery list page, brewery's near you, and a users profile. 
- Use react-router and react-router-dom to navigate to different link/pages. 
- Use axios to get a API request.
- Allow uses to add beers and breweries to their users profile. 
- Filter breweries based on breweries geographical location. 


#### PostMVP for Brewery App
- Add drinking games to the app to play.
- Search feature to search for specific brewery and/or beers. 
- Incorporate Google Maps. 
- Improve CSS styling.
